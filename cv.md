## *About me*
I just started my journey in learning frond-end programming. All my life I'm learning something: play piano, knitting, wood's carving or dancing bachata. Couple years ago I had an attempt to learn something about graphic design, because I always have interest in art, drawing, something what you can do with your own arms or something that you can see on screen. So now I fond of front-end development. I believe that I'll deal with all stages of studying and I hope I can change my profession after RS School.
